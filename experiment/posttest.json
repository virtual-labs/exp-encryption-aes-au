      "question": "How many rounds of encryption does AES-128 perform?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "8",
        "b": "10",
        "c": "12",
        "d": "14"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. AES-128 performs more than 8 rounds.",
        "b": "Correct. AES-128 performs 10 rounds of encryption.",
        "c": "Incorrect. AES-192 performs 12 rounds, not AES-128.",
        "d": "Incorrect. AES-256 performs 14 rounds, not AES-128."

      "question": "In the AES encryption process, which step is omitted in the final round?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "SubBytes",
        "b": "ShiftRows",
        "c": "MixColumns",
        "d": "AddRoundKey"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. SubBytes is not omitted; it is part of every round including the final round.",
        "b": "Incorrect. ShiftRows is performed in the final round as well.",
        "c": "Correct. MixColumns is omitted in the final round to prepare for the output of encrypted data.",
        "d": "Incorrect. AddRoundKey occurs in every round, including the final round."

    {
      "question": "Which property of AES ensures that changing one byte of plaintext affects many bytes of ciphertext after a few rounds?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Confusion",
        "b": "Avalanche effect through repeated SPN rounds",
        "c": "Key padding",
        "d": "S-box linearity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Confusion is related to the substitution step but does not describe the multi-byte effect.",
        "b": "Correct. The avalanche effect through repeated SPN rounds ensures that small changes in plaintext lead to large changes in ciphertext.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Key padding is not the property responsible for this effect.",
        "d": "Incorrect. S-box is nonlinear, not linear, and this property is not about S-box linearity."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best explains why AES uses both substitution and permutation operations?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To reduce key storage",
        "b": "To alternate between linear and nonlinear transformations for stronger security",
        "c": "To simplify decryption",
        "d": "To maintain block size"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Substitution and permutation operations do not reduce key storage.",
        "b": "Correct. AES alternates between linear (permutation) and nonlinear (substitution) transformations to provide both confusion and diffusion.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Using both operations actually makes decryption more complex, not simpler.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Block size is maintained regardless of the operations used."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "If the round keys generated during key expansion are weak or predictable, which part of AES is most directly affected?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "ShiftRows becomes linear",
        "b": "MixColumns fails to perform diffusion",
        "c": "AddRoundKey becomes ineffective",
        "d": "SubBytes produces constant output"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. ShiftRows is not affected by weak round keys; it is a deterministic permutation.",
        "b": "Incorrect. MixColumns performs its diffusion regardless of the round keys.",
        "c": "Correct. If round keys are weak or predictable, the AddRoundKey operation becomes ineffective as the XOR with a predictable key provides little security.",
        "d": "Incorrect. SubBytes produces output based on the substitution box, not the round keys."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
