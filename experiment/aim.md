### Aim of the experiment
To understand the complete process of message encryption using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) by utilizing a visual simulation tool, enabling students to observe each transformation step—including key generation, substitution, permutation, and round-wise operations—thereby gaining practical insight into how AES securely converts plaintext into ciphertext.
